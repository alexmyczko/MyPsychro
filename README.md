# PSYCHROMETRIC CALCULATOR

A simple interactive CLI psychrometric calculator based on the library from
http://numlog.ca/psychrometrics/psychrometrics.html

This is a legacy project to give Objective-C a try some years ago when I was a Mac
OS X user. It ran successfully on Windows and OS X and is now adopted to Linux.

## Dependencies 
* Psychrometrics C/C++ library (download from http://numlog.ca/psychrometrics/psychrometrics.html)

#### Mac OS X
Should compile on Mac OS X with Xcode out of the box.

#### Linux
* build-essentials
* gnustep
* gnustep-devel

A makefile is provided to compile and (static) link a standalone executable.
